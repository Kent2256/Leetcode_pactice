Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], 
Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). 
The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

 

Example 1:

â€‹
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

Constraints:

n == points.length
2 <= n <= 105
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 109

class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        vector<int> res_list;
        for(auto p:points)res_list.push_back(p[0]);
        sort(res_list.begin(),res_list.end());
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i < res_list.size()-1;i++){
            res=max(res, res_list[i+1] - res_list[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
