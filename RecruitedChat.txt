Hello Angie, my name is Kent Chang. Sorry about that I did not mark the role at the booking title. The booking system only have columns of first and last name.
I am a Software Engineer at Quanta Computer and my job is server diagnosis script maintain and develop. I started at this Company in April 2022
I have owend the projects for four Cloud Servidce Providers, Google, Meta, MSFT and Amazon. And there are two special porjects to co-developing the diagnosis with Google and Meta.
The co-developing project with google is based on ocp structure, which is methioned on the prefered qualifications.


Question:
1.  I check the CakeResume and it shows that this job opportunity has been opend about 4 mounths.
    It means that no one get this offer or you keep hiring new empolyments.
2.  Mainly task for this role is to develop and maintain server bios?
